[hagrid]TAD-DA-DA-DAAA!
0:08
[hagrid]Isn't he beautiful?
0:12
[hagrid]Say hello to Buckbeak.
0:15
[ron]Hagrid.
0:15
[ron]Exactly what is that?
0:17
[hagrid]That Ron, is a Hippogriff.
0:20
[hagrid]First thing you want to know about Hippogriff's is that they're very proud creatures.
0:23
[hagrid]Very easily offended.
0:25
[hagrid]You do not want to insult a Hippogriff.
0:27
[hagrid]It may just be the last thing you ever do.
0:30
[hagrid]Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
0:36
[hagrid]Well done Harry. Well done.
0:41
[hagrid]Come on now.
0:43
[hagrid]Now, you have to let him make the first move.
0:46
[hagrid]It's only polite. So, step up. Give him a nice bow.
0:50
[hagrid]Then you wait and see if he bows back.
0:52
[hagrid]If he does, you can go and touch him.
0:55
[hagrid]If not, well, we'll get to that later.
1:01
[hagrid]Make your bow.
1:05
[hagrid]Nice and low.
1:12
[hagrid]Back off, Harry. Back off.
1:13
[twig snaps]
1:15
[hagrid]Keep still.
1:18
[hagrid]Keep still.
1:27
[hagrid]Oh! Well done, Harry. Well done.
1:30
[hagrid]Here, you big brute.
1:36
[hagrid]Right. I think you can go and pat him now.
1:38
[hagrid]Go on. Don't be shy.
1:48
[hagrid]Nice and slow now.
1:50
[hagrid]Nice and slow.
1:54
[hagrid]Not so fast, Harry.
2:01
[hagrid]Slow down, Harry.
2:04
[hagrid]Nice and slow.
2:05
[hagrid]Now let him come to you.
2:09
[hagrid]Slow now.
2:10
[hagrid]Slowly. Slowly. That's it.
2:14
[hagrid]Yes!
2:16
[hagrid]Well done! Oh, well done, Harry! Well done!
2:22
[hagrid]I think he may let you ride him now.
2:23
[harry]What?
2:25
[hagrid]Come on.
2:26
[harry]Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hagrid!
[hagrid]Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
2:30
[hagrid]Don't pull out any of his feathers
2:32
[hagrid]because he won't thank you for that.
2:41
[Harry]Whoa!
3:39
[harry]Whoo-hoo!
3:44
[Harry]Whoo-hoo!
3:58
[hagrid]{whistles}

[hagrid]Well done, Harry!
4:17
[hagrid]And well done, Buckbeak!
